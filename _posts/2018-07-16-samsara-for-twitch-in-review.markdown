Although I have an HTML5 version, porting to Twitch was a different challenge. First, it was hard for me to understand Twitch itself. :) Second, the development environment is insufficient and unstable. Last, there are many restrictions both client and server side.

Nevertheless, porting to Twitch Extension was a very good experience. Several Twitch technicians supported me in detail. Thanks to that guys, I could finish my job.
